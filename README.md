# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# React Todo App

A simple and interactive Todo application built with React. This app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and it stores the tasks locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add a new task to the list.
- **Edit Todo**: Users can edit the title of an existing task.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can delete a task from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Todos are stored locally in the browser so that they persist across page reloads.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the application by visiting: [Demo URL](#).

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hacking-OS/React-Todo-App.git
cd React-Todo-App
npm run dev
